<h4>By public transportation</h4>
<p>Public transportation is possible with the bus line n. 101 operated by
    <a href="https://moovitapp.com/lines?lgid=518067&lid=1951322&utm_medium=link&utm_source=shared&metroId=1262&lang=it">ARST</a>.<br />
        
      The Sant'Elmo bus stop is not always served, so a taxi might be needed for the last 3/4 km.
      Public transport is not very efficient, so we recommend our shuttle service.
</p>

<h4>By our private shuttle transfer</h4>
<p> Upon request, shuttle transfers from/to Cagliari Elmas Airport are organized according to flights arrivals/departures.
    Precise rates will be communicated after all subscriptions will be registered.
