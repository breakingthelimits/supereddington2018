    RATIONALE AND PROGRAM
    ---------------------

    Recent years have seen an increasing interest of the astronomical community
    on the topic of super-Eddington accretion on compact objects, which can
    apply to a variety of systems, such as supermassive black holes, black hole
    binaries, ULXs, neutron stars. Moreover, the possibility that the Eddington
    limit may be violated can have important implications for the related topics
    of black hole growth, galaxy evolution and AGN feedback.

    This workshop will be an opportunity to compare recent observations with
    state-of-the-art theoretical modeling of super-Eddington flows, and to
    discuss the cosmological implications of this regime of accretion.

    Tentative list of sessions:
    Accretion and ejection physics
    Black hole growth and galaxy evolution
    Active Galactic Nuclei and quasars
    Galactic super-Eddington black holes and neutron stars
    Ultraluminous X-ray sources
    Gamma-ray bursts and tidal disruption events
    New and future observatories: ASTRO-H, NICER, Astrosat, Athena, JWST, SKA, â€¦

    REGISTRATION
    ------------

    A registration form will be available on the website soon
    (http://goo.gl/rCXUkG). The conference fee is expected to be around
    250 euros for early registers, and the early registration deadline, yet to
    be decided, should be around the end of May.

    VENUE
    -----

    The conference will be held at the Arbatax Park Resort, in Arbatax (OG), a
    small town along the beautiful east coast of Sardinia. This resort offers a
    variety of lodging solutions and discounted prices for conference
    participants (as low as ~60E/night for the basic solution). Participants are
    encouraged to use these offers for convenience.

    This is the website of the Arbatax Park Resort:

    The Travel Information page on the conference website will be updated soon.

    SOCIAL EVENTS
    -------------

    Besides the traditional social dinner, during this workshop we will organize
    a visit to the recently commissioned Sardinia Radio Telescope
    (http://srt.inaf.it), a 64-m antenna for Radio Astronomy, Geodynamical
    studies and Space science, with active surface and bleeding-edge technology,
    able to work either in single dish or in VLBI mode.
