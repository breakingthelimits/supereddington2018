    RATIONALE AND PROGRAM
    ---------------------
    Recent years have seen an increasing interest of the astronomical
    community on the topic of super-Eddington accretion on compact
    objects, which can apply to a variety of systems, such as
    supermassive black holes, black hole binaries, ULXs, neutron
    stars. The possibility that the Eddington limit may be violated
    can have important implications for the related topics of
    black hole growth, galaxy evolution and AGN feedback.


    After two years from the first edition of Breaking the limits,
    we reconvene to discuss the advancement done in the last two years.


    This workshop will be an opportunity to compare recent observations
    with state-of-the-art theoretical modeling of super-Eddington flows,
    and to discuss the cosmological implications of this regime of
    accretion.


    LIST OF SESSIONS:
    -----------------


    Accretion and ejection physics
    Black hole growth and galaxy evolution
    Active Galactic Nuclei and quasars
    Galactic super-Eddington black holes and neutron stars 
    Ultraluminous X-ray sources
    Gamma-ray bursts and tidal disruption events
    New and future observatories: NICER, Athena, XARM, ...

    VENUE

    -----


    The conference will be held at the Sant’Elmo Beach Hotel,
    in Castiadas (CA), a small town along the beautiful East
    coast of Sardinia, in Italy. This resort offers a variety
    of lodging solutions and discounted prices for conference
    participants. Please reserve your room as soon as possible
    through the Kassiopea secretariat to get the discount.



    SOCIAL EVENTS
    
    -------------


    Besides the traditional social dinner, during this workshop
    it will be possible to visit to the recently commissioned
    Sardinia Radio Telescope (http://srt.inaf.it), a 64-m
    antenna for Radio Astronomy, Geodynamical studies and Space
    science, with active surface and cutting-edge technology,
    able to work either in single dish or in VLBI mode.
